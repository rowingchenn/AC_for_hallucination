How would you rate the pain on a scale from 1 to 10?\n\nThe pain in my flank is more like a dull ache that's there most of the time, but it does get worse at times. I'd say it usually hovers around a 4, but it can spike up to a 7 or so.\n\nHave you noticed any changes in your urine, such as color, frequency, or pain during urination?\n\nNo, I haven't noticed any changes in the color or frequency of my urine, and there's no pain when I urinate either.

Should I have those tests done to figure out what's going on?\n\nYes, I think it would be beneficial to have some tests done to better understand your condition.

There hasn't been any improvement in those areas.\n\nThank you for clarifying that.

It doesn't really spread much from there.\n\nThank you for specifying the location. Have you been able to bear weight on that leg, or does it feel too painful to put pressure on it?\n\nIt's quite painful to put pressure on it. I can bear some weight, but I have to limp to avoid the worst of the pain.\n\nThank you for that information. Have you noticed any clicking or grinding sensations in your knee when you move it or bear weight on it?\n\nNo, I haven't felt any clicking or grinding sensations.

Can you tell me how long you've been experiencing swelling and pain in your right ring finger?\n\nHi Dr. Agent, it started about two days ago after I was playing football. My finger got caught in someone's jersey, and they pulled away pretty hard.\n\nDid you notice any immediate changes in the shape of your finger or hear any popping sounds when the injury occurred?\n\nNo, I didn't notice any changes in shape or hear any popping sounds at that moment. It just started swelling later and became really painful.\n\nThank you for that information. Have you experienced any numbness or tingling in the affected finger or any other fingers on that hand?\n\nNo, I haven't felt any numbness or tingling, just the pain and swelling in that specific finger.\n\nHave you had any difficulty moving the finger or noticed any stiffness in the joint since the injury occurred?\n\nYes, I've had trouble bending it at the last joint when I try to make a fist. It's also been staying kind of straight when I'm not doing anything with it.\n\nThank you for sharing that. Have you noticed any color changes or temperature differences in the affected finger compared to the others?\n\nNo, there haven't been any color changes or differences in temperature. It just looks more swollen compared to the others.\n\nHave you taken any medications or tried any treatments at home to alleviate the pain and swelling?\n\nI've only taken some over-the-counter pain relievers and tried icing it, but it hasn't helped much with the swelling or pain.\n\nHave you had any previous injuries or surgeries on this finger or hand before this incident?\n\nNo, I've never had any injuries or surgeries on this hand or finger before this incident.\n\nThank you for that information. Have you noticed any changes in the skin around the swollen area, such as redness or warmth to the touch?\n\nNo, there's no redness or warmth, just the swelling and pain that I mentioned earlier.\n\nHave you experienced any fever or felt generally unwell since the injury occurred?\n\nNo, I haven't had a fever or felt unwell overall; it's mainly just the issues with my finger that have been bothering me.\n\nHave you tried any form of immobilization for your finger, like a splint or buddy taping it to another finger?\n\nNo, I haven't tried immobilizing it yet. Do you think that could help with the swelling and pain?\n\nYes, immobilizing the finger could help reduce movement and potentially alleviate some pain and swelling. Have you noticed any clicking or locking of the finger when you try to move it?\n\nNo, there hasn't been any clicking or locking when I try to move it. It just doesn't bend properly at the last joint and stays somewhat extended.\n\nHave you been able to perform your daily activities, or has the pain and swelling significantly affected your ability to use your hand?\n\nIt's definitely affected my ability to use my hand, especially for writing and gripping things. It's been pretty frustrating not being able to do simple tasks.\n\nThank you for sharing that. Have you noticed any bruising around the affected area or any other visual changes besides the swelling?\n\nNo, I haven't noticed any bruising or other visual changes, just the swelling and the pain that's been persistent.\n\nHave you had any previous conditions or diseases that affect your bones or joints, such as arthritis or osteoporosis?\n\nNo, I haven't had any conditions like arthritis or osteoporosis. My medical history has been pretty uneventful until this incident.\n\nThank you for providing all that information. Have you noticed any improvement or worsening of the symptoms since the injury occurred two days ago?\n\nActually, it seems like the swelling and pain have gotten a bit worse since the injury. I haven't seen any improvement yet.\n\nThank you for that update. Given the worsening of symptoms, I would like to request a test to better assess the structure of your finger.

Given the lack of fluid accumulation and the nature of your symptoms, I'm leaning towards a specific diagnosis. Have you had any previous episodes similar to this, even if minor, in any of your joints?\n\nNo, this is the first time I've had anything like this happen to any of my joints.

Just the lesion and some swelling in my legs.\n\nHave you had any recent injuries or insect bites in the area where the lesion developed?\n\nYes, I remember being bitten by an ant at the same spot before the lesion started to develop.\n\nThank you for that information. Have you noticed any pus or fluid coming from the lesion?\n\nNo, there hasn't been any pus, but the center of the lesion looks kind of necrotic and the borders are purplish and irregular. It's quite painful too.\n\nThank you for the detailed description. Have you had any similar lesions in the past, or is this the first occurrence?\n\nThis is the first time I've had anything like this. I've never experienced a lesion quite so painful and unusual before.\n\nHave you been experiencing any numbness or tingling around the area of the lesion?\n\nNo, I haven't felt any numbness or tingling around it, just the pain and discomfort from the lesion itself.\n\nHave you been in contact with any unusual substances or environments that could have exposed you to bacteria or toxins?\n\nWell, I did travel to Wisconsin a couple of months ago, but I can't recall coming into contact with any unusual substances or environments.\n\nThank you for sharing that. Have you been in contact with any animals or insects other than the ant bite you mentioned?\n\nNo, just the ant bite. I haven't been around any other animals or insects that I can recall.\n\nHave you been taking any medications or using any topical treatments on the lesion since you first noticed it?\n\nNo, I haven't used any medications or topical treatments on it. I wasn't sure what to put on it, so I thought it best to see you first.\n\nThank you for being cautious about applying treatments without guidance. Have you noticed any changes in your overall health, such as weight loss, fatigue, or changes in appetite since the lesion appeared?\n\nNo, I haven't noticed any significant changes in my overall health like weight loss or changes in appetite. Just the discomfort from the lesion and the swelling in my legs.\n\nHave you had any recent changes in your diet or started new supplements that might have affected your skin or immune system?\n\nNo, I haven't made any recent changes to my diet or started any new supplements. Everything has been pretty consistent with what I usually eat and take.\n\nHave you been exposed to any extreme temperatures or harsh weather conditions that might have affected the area where the lesion developed?\n\nNo, I haven't been exposed to any extreme temperatures or harsh weather conditions recently. The weather has been quite normal for this time of year.\n\nHave you or anyone in your family had a history of skin conditions or autoimmune diseases?\n\nWell, I have Crohn's disease, which is an autoimmune condition, and I was treated for anterior uveitis about 8 months ago. But no one in my family has had any similar skin conditions as far as I know.\n\nThank you for sharing that information. Have you been under any unusual stress or had any significant life changes recently that might have impacted your immune system?\n\nNo, there haven't been any unusual stressors or significant life changes recently that could have impacted my immune system. Everything has been relatively stable in that regard.\n\nHave you noticed any changes in the color or size of the lesion since it first appeared?\n\nYes, the lesion has definitely changed in size; it's gotten larger and the color has become darker, especially around the edges. The center looks more necrotic now than when it first appeared.\n\nThank you for the update. Have you experienced any bleeding from the lesion or does it seem to be confined to the necrotic and discoloration changes?\n\nNo, there hasn't been any bleeding from the lesion. It's mostly just the necrotic center and the discoloration around the edges that I've noticed.\n\nHave you been experiencing any unusual or persistent fatigue that seems unrelated to your normal activities?\n\nNo, I haven't experienced any unusual or persistent fatigue. My energy levels have been pretty normal, aside from the discomfort caused by the lesion and leg swelling.\n\nThank you for all the information. Given the necrotic center and purplish, irregular borders of the lesion, I would like to request a specific test to help us get a clearer picture of what we're dealing with. REQUEST TEST: Skin biopsy.\n\nRESULTS: Histopathology findings from the skin biopsy show neutrophilic infiltration without infection, consistent with pyoderma gangrenosum.\n\nThank you for your patience. Based on the biopsy results and your symptoms, I believe we have enough information to make a diagnosis.
