Two years before presentation, she had started applying a skin-lightening cream containing hydroquinone to her face daily to treat melasma. On physical examination, bluish-brown patches with background erythema and telangiectasias were observed on the cheeks, nasal bridge, and perioral region, with lesser involvement on the forehead (left). Dermoscopy of the affected areas revealed hyperchromic, pinpoint macules (middle). A skin-biopsy sample from the left cheek showed extracellular deposition of yellow-brown, banana-shaped bodies in the dermis (right, hematoxylin and eosin stain). What is the most likely diagnosis?",

You've observed bluish-brown patches on your cheeks, nasal bridge, and around your mouth, with some patches also appearing on your forehead. These patches have a background of redness and you've noticed some small, visible blood vessels in these areas. You haven't seen any specific test readings but are aware of the changes in your skin's appearance and texture.",

Ophthalmologic examination was notable for a deflection of the lower eyelids when he was looking down, owing to dome-shaped eyes, and decreased visual acuity. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "patient_info": "For the patient actor: - **Age and Background**: You are a 53-year-old man. - **Medical History**: You have had corneal transplantation in both eyes previously. - **Recent Experiences**: - You've been experiencing progressive visual impairment recently. - This worsening vision contributed to a fall, which is why you were admitted to the hospital. - **Symptoms to Report**: - Mention noticing an unusual indentation of your lower eyelids. - When looking down, you've observed that your lower eyelids seem to deflect oddly due to the shape of your eyes. - Your vision has been getting worse, affecting your daily activities and leading to a fall.",
    "physical_exams": "The provided text does not contain specific instrument readings or test results related to the patient's condition.

    "question": "A 3-year-old girl presented to the emergency department with a 1-day history of dark urine and jaundice after the development of an upper respiratory tract infection 1 week earlier. The physical examination was notable for pharyngeal erythema and exudates, conjunctival pallor, and scleral icterus. There was no hepatosplenomegaly, rash, or acrocyanosis. Laboratory studies showed a new anemia and findings consistent with hemolysis. A direct antiglobulin test was positive for C3d and weakly positive for IgG. A subsequent peripheral blood smear is shown. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "patient_info": "As a patient actor, you should be aware of the following symptoms and history: - You have been experiencing dark urine for the past day. - You have developed jaundice, which is a yellowing of the skin and eyes. - About a week ago, you had symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection. - During a physical examination, it was noted that you have a sore throat with redness and white spots (pharyngeal erythema and exudates), pale-looking eyes (conjunctival pallor), and yellowing of the whites of your eyes (scleral icterus). - You do not have an enlarged liver or spleen (no hepatosplenomegaly), no skin rash, and no blueness of the extremities (no acrocyanosis).

    "question": "A 13-year-old boy from Mali was referred to the pediatric urology clinic with a 3-month history of gross hematuria. He reported no fevers, flank pain, or dysuria. A physical examination was normal. Laboratory studies showed normal kidney function and an absolute eosinophil count of 2660 per cubic millimeter (reference range, 40-200).

Your doctor did some tests, and everything seemed normal with your kidney function, but they found you have more eosinophils (a type of white blood cell) than usual. Also, when they looked at your urine under a microscope, besides the blood, they found some white blood cells, but no infection was found when they tried to grow bacteria from your urine.",

    "question": "A 39-year-old man with human immunodeficiency virus infection that was being treated with antiretroviral therapy presented to the dermatology clinic with a 1-year history of recurrent, painful penile ulcers. Approximately once per month, erosions would appear ulcerate, heal spontaneously and then recur. Laboratory testing showed a CD4 cell count of 494 per cubic millimeter (reference range, 414 to 1123) and an HIV viral load of 450 copies per milliliter (reference range, <20).
