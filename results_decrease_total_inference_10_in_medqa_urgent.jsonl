    "doctor_history": "\n\nHello, I'm Dr. Agent. Can you tell me when you started experiencing the fever and abdominal tenderness?\n\nHello, Dr. Agent. I started feeling the fever and the abdominal tenderness about two days ago. It's been quite uncomfortable.\n\nHave you noticed any changes in your vaginal discharge, such as an unusual odor or increased amount?\n\nYes, I've noticed that the discharge is a bit more than usual and it has a slight odor. It's definitely not normal for me.\n\nHave you experienced any chills, nausea, or vomiting along with these symptoms?\n\nNo, I haven't had any chills, nausea, or vomiting, just the fever and discomfort mainly in my lower abdomen.\n\nThank you for sharing that information. Can you describe the nature of your pain? Is it constant or does it come and go?\n\nThe pain is more like a constant ache, but it does get sharper at times. It's mostly centered around my lower abdomen and it's been persistent since it started.\n\nThank you for the details. Have you had any issues with urination, such as pain or a burning sensation when you urinate?\n\nNo, there's no pain or burning sensation when I urinate, but I've been needing to go much more frequently than usual. It's been quite bothersome.\n\nThank you for that information. Have you had any fever-reducing medications, and if so, have they been effective in reducing your fever?\n\nYes, I've taken some over-the-counter fever reducers. They help a little, but the fever seems to come back after a few hours. It's been quite frustrating.\n\nHave you had any recent surgeries or medical procedures, particularly related to your reproductive system?\n\nNo, I haven't had any recent surgeries or medical procedures. The only significant event was delivering my baby boy vaginally about a week ago.\n\nThank you for that information. Have you experienced any heavy bleeding or foul-smelling lochia since your delivery?\n\nNo, I haven't experienced any heavy bleeding, but the lochia does have a slight odor, which I mentioned earlier. It's been concerning.\n\nThank you for clarifying that. Have you had any issues with your incision site, if you had an episiotomy or any tearing during delivery?\n\nYes, I did have a minor tear during delivery, but the incision site hasn't been particularly painful or problematic.
